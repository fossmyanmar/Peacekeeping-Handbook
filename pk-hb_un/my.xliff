It is not intended to provide strategic or policy guidance. Rather, it is intended to provide field personnel who are new to the United Nations, or who are being deployed to one of our multidimensional peacekeeping operations for the first time, with general background on the responsibilities of each component of our operations and how these fit together to form the whole. We have tried to make the Handbook as brief and practical as possible, while doing justice to the broad areas of work in which many of our operations are engaged.</source>

Over the decades, the UN has helped to contain or end numerous conflicts, in many cases through the deployment of peacekeeping operations.</source>

A large number of peacekeeping operations are still based on the “traditional” model of a military operation deployed in support of a political activity. These operations involve military tasks such as monitoring ceasefires and patrolling buffer zones between hostile parties and are carried out by UN peacekeepers who may or may not be armed and who are widely known as "blue helmets" or "blue berets" because of their distinctive headgear. Although past military observer missions have also included non-military tasks, a growing number of UN peacekeeping operations have become multidimensional, composed of a range of components including military, civilian police, political, civil affairs, rule of law, human rights, humanitarian, reconstruction, public information and gender. Some of these operations do not have a military component but carry out their mandates alongside a regional or multinational peacekeeping force.</source>

Member States providing these essential elements are reimbursed from the mission budget at agreed-upon rates. Contributing personnel to peacekeeping is not obligatory and a troop-contributing country (TCC) retains the right to withdraw its personnel from an operation. Many countries also voluntarily make available, on a non- reimbursable basis, additional resources to support UN peacekeeping efforts, in the form of transportation, supplies, personnel and financial contributions, above and beyond their assessed share of peacekeeping costs.</source>

As part of its reporting responsibilities, political affairs coordinates inputs for reports to UN Headquarters in New York from all mission components as well as other UN organizations. In some missions, field offices or <g id="233">regional </g>headquarters are headed by a political affairs officer who coordinates reporting to the mission headquarters by all the other components deployed in that area. The coordinating function of political affairs ensures that reporting reflects the integrated approach required from multidimensional operations and that the different offices and components are not providing repetitive or conflicting information.</target>

        <target>In November 2000, SHIRBRIG had its first deployment; SHIRBRIG units from Canada, Denmark and the Netherlands deployed to the Horn of Africa for the newly established United Nations Mission in Ethiopia and Eritrea (UNMEE). SHIRBRIG forces remained on the ground for six months and were instrumental in the successful establishment of the mission. In 2003, SHIRBRIG provided headquarters staff support to the interim force headquarters of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and assisted the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) plan their UN-authorized operation in Côte d’Ivoire.</target>

Because contributing States are reimbursed by the Organization for the use of contingent-owned equipment, the mission is also responsible for verifying the quantity, quality and condition of the items upon arrival in the field, periodically throughout the deployment period and prior to departure from the mission area. The specifications of the material and equipment brought by contingents is agreed by the Organization and the contingent country and is set out in a memorandum of understanding that is concluded between the contributing government and the UN prior <g id="421">to </g>deployment.

During the 1990s, however, the nature of conflicts changed dramatically with more than 90 percent of conflicts taking place within, rather than between, States.
