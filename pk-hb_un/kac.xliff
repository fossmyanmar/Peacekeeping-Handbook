The head of civil administration holds a higher position within the mission, typically as a Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (DSRSG), and is comparable to a prime minister of the central level governing bodies and administrator of regional and municipal bodies. She or he is responsible for leading the administration while ensuring the creation of the necessary conditions for a transition from an international administration to local governance at all levels. Civil affairs and political affairs officers assist the DSRSG in coordination, political analysis, policy development, reporting, management and oversight. In addition, civil affairs officers are assigned to key administrative positions at the central, regional and municipal levels.</source>

These partners may be in a position to support the work of civil affairs officers through, for example, the organization of reconciliation programmes, human rights awareness campaigns, return of displaced persons initiatives and economic development. Contacts with multilateral and bilateral donors may also lead to technical assistance and/or funding support for the implementation of objectives that are outside the mission’s budget but deemed critical for the implementation of the mandate.</source>

UNTSO's role became increasingly important because disagreements between the parties often led to deadlock over sensitive issues and the military representatives of the parties found it difficult to cooperate. Following the wars of 1956, 1967 and 1973, the functions of the observers changed along with the circumstances, but they remained in the area, acting as go-betweens for the hostile parties and as the means by which isolated incidents could be contained and prevented from escalating into major conflicts.</source>

The reintegration task is a civilian function normally undertaken by the national authorities and assisted by the international community, including the peacekeeping operation. The three phases are inter-linked and interdependent, however.

Therefore, the DDR process needs to be properly planned as a continuous process and appropriately resourced from the outset.</source>

The community policing approach enhances the confidence of the local community in the police and fosters cooperative relationships. It provides reassurances to vulnerable groups, returning refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), owing to the visible presence of police officers working with local populations in and among the community. Addressing common community and policing concerns through, and with, the community can help to ensure that improvements in law and order are better understood and accepted by the population. As such, community policing is a key approach for civilian police in peacekeeping missions. Many host countries of peacekeeping operations have certain entrenched local policing practices. These can be adapted to include modern community policing practices. The local communities must be encouraged to address their own social problems. Civilian police can act as a catalyst for the participation of the local communities in finding solutions to their security and justice problems.</source>

All components are heavily dependent on the support structure to be able to perform and meet mission objectives. The relationship between the substantive components and the mission support elements is, therefore, of critical importance. Innovative approaches, such as the concept of integrated support services, have been adopted to improve cooperation among all components and integrated planning for a more rational use of mission assets and resources. Mission support elements, which must comply with strict rules and regulations of the Organization, sometimes face criticism for not being responsive enough to mission operational requirements, especially during crises. Knowing the roles and responsibilities of all components and elements can contribute to a common understanding of priorities and the provision of optimum support with necessary controls.</source>

Generally, the Bank’s IDA resources are dispersed based on policy performance evaluated by the country policy and institutional assessment (CPIA) indicators. A country gets more resources the better its implementation of economic and social policies that promote growth and poverty reduction. This often works against post- conflict countries, however, since they typically have performed poorly on this front at the very time they most need financial resources. The Bank, therefore, devised a new set of indicators better tailored for post-conflict countries, such as human security and progress towards peace and governance. A country is typically expected to return to IDA’s regular (CPIA-based) allocation process within three years.</source>

The RC can promote the participation and engagement of a wide range of stakeholders in the peace process, including civil society and community leaders, and a wide spectrum of political actors, donors and international financial institutions, such as the World Bank. The RC can assist in the development of a peacebuilding strategy that includes inputs from all these stakeholders. The RC can also facilitate participatory forums for national dialogue that allow all actors to have a say in the shaping of post-conflict arrangements, including possibly a constitutional or legislative framework for good and accountable governance.</source>

In the formulation of transitional appeals, the substantive input of the UN country team is vital to ensuring that short-term recovery priorities, such as funds for the reintegration of former combatants and displaced persons, are balanced with early support for long-term processes and institutions necessary for democratic governance.</source>

The Consultative Group meeting on Sierra Leone in Paris in November 2002 was co-chaired by the World Bank and UNDP and dealt with the Sierra Leone’s peace and security, humanitarian, and development needs in an integrated way.</source>

A number of additional posts could be created, for example, within the RC’s office to support peacebuilding efforts. In Côte d’Ivoire, UNDP has provided a senior governance adviser to the RC to ensure that governance issues are adequately addressed in the peace consolidation strategy. Creative ways of funding these posts can be explored, including the use of trust funds, bilateral donors or including the posts in the peacekeeping operation’s budget. Provisions for additional personnel posts, especially those involved in the implementation of reintegration and recovery programmes, should be included in all transitional appeals.

If properly planned, coordinated and managed, the exit strategy of a peacekeeping operation could very well constitute handing over key activities and programmes to the RC and UN country team for continued implementation. RCs can work to deepen and strengthen the short-term economic recovery that may have been established during a peacekeeping operation. With appropriate funding and political support, RCs can undertake and facilitate the long-term initiatives necessary to stabilize fragile political systems according to the principles of participation, accountability, good governance and rule of law.</source>
