The SRSG can support the agencies by facilitating access to the parties, supporting fund-raising efforts, conveying concerns to the appropriate entity, and offering security and political leverage. The UN agencies, in turn, can provide the SRSG with in-depth knowledge of the local situation and their vast networks of local contacts and may implement important elements of the mandate, such as humanitarian and developmental assistance, that are not covered in the mission's budget. To this end, the SRSG convenes regular meetings of all UN entities in the mission area and maintains continuous contact to ensure that the activities of the UN system in the mission area are mutually supportive and coordinated. In some cases, it has proven useful to appoint the resident coordinator/humanitarian coordinator as Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (DSRSG) to ensure greater strategic coherence and an effective transition from emergency relief to recovery and reconstruction.</source>
