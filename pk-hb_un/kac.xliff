The SRSG can support the agencies by facilitating access to the parties, supporting fund-raising efforts, conveying concerns to the appropriate entity, and offering security and political leverage. The UN agencies, in turn, can provide the SRSG with in-depth knowledge of the local situation and their vast networks of local contacts and may implement important elements of the mandate, such as humanitarian and developmental assistance, that are not covered in the mission's budget. To this end, the SRSG convenes regular meetings of all UN entities in the mission area and maintains continuous contact to ensure that the activities of the UN system in the mission area are mutually supportive and coordinated. In some cases, it has proven useful to appoint the resident coordinator/humanitarian coordinator as Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (DSRSG) to ensure greater strategic coherence and an effective transition from emergency relief to recovery and reconstruction.</source>

In 2003, SHIRBRIG provided headquarters staff support to the interim force headquarters of the United Nations Mission in Liberia (UNMIL) and assisted the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) plan their UN-authorized operation in Côte d’Ivoire.</source>

Examples of these mandates include the missions in Haiti, Bosnia and Herzegovina and Eastern Slavonia in Croatia. Missions mandated to support local police reform initially did so by providing training and mentoring. The primary goal of training local police has been to strengthen police services so that their conduct and services are professional, effective and comply with international standards for democratic policing.</source>
