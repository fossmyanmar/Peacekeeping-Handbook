Therefore, a unified regional or sub-regional approach to a conflict is often a critical part of an international strategy to achieve stability in the mission area and the region. The SRSG therefore works closely with special envoys or Special Representatives of the Secretary- General or other UN representations in the region as well as with regional organizations and entities. In some cases, regional organizations may even be integrated into the structure of the mission.</source>

The SRSG can support the agencies by facilitating access to the parties, supporting fund-raising efforts, conveying concerns to the appropriate entity, and offering security and political leverage. The UN agencies, in turn, can provide the SRSG with in-depth knowledge of the local situation and their vast networks of local contacts and may implement important elements of the mandate, such as humanitarian and developmental assistance, that are not covered in the mission's budget. To this end, the SRSG convenes regular meetings of all UN entities in the mission area and maintains continuous contact to ensure that the activities of the UN system in the mission area are mutually supportive and coordinated. In some cases, it has proven useful to appoint the resident coordinator/humanitarian coordinator as Deputy Special Representative of the Secretary-General (DSRSG) to ensure greater strategic coherence and an effective transition from emergency relief to recovery and reconstruction.</source>

The community policing approach enhances the confidence of the local community in the police and fosters cooperative relationships. It provides reassurances to vulnerable groups, returning refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs), owing to the visible presence of police officers working with local populations in and among the community. Addressing common community and policing concerns through, and with, the community can help to ensure that improvements in law and order are better understood and accepted by the population. As such, community policing is a key approach for civilian police in peacekeeping missions. Many host countries of peacekeeping operations have certain entrenched local policing practices. These can be adapted to include modern community policing practices. The local communities must be encouraged to address their own social problems. Civilian police can act as a catalyst for the participation of the local communities in finding solutions to their security and justice problems.</source>

Generally, the Bank’s IDA resources are dispersed based on policy performance evaluated by the country policy and institutional assessment (CPIA) indicators. A country gets more resources the better its implementation of economic and social policies that promote growth and poverty reduction. This often works against post- conflict countries, however, since they typically have performed poorly on this front at the very time they most need financial resources. The Bank, therefore, devised a new set of indicators better tailored for post-conflict countries, such as human security and progress towards peace and governance. A country is typically expected to return to IDA’s regular (CPIA-based) allocation process within three years.</source>
