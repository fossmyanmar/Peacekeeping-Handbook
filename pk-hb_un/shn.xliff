It is not intended to provide strategic or policy guidance. Rather, it is intended to provide field personnel who are new to the United Nations, or who are being deployed to one of our multidimensional peacekeeping operations for the first time, with general background on the responsibilities of each component of our operations and how these fit together to form the whole. We have tried to make the Handbook as brief and practical as possible, while doing justice to the broad areas of work in which many of our operations are engaged.</source>

The UN can bring unique skills and resources to bear on conflicts that are ready for resolution, thus helping to alleviate the suffering of people affected by war and assisting them in the reconstruction of their post-conflict societies. Multidimensional peacekeeping cannot be rolled out at will, however, and there is no “one-size-fits-all” model. To succeed, peacekeeping operations must have clear mandates and adequate resources and must be tailored to fit the political, regional and other realities of the country or territory in question. Most important, they must respond to the desires and aspirations of the local population. Only then do multidimensional peacekeeping operations serve as a truly effective tool as the UN strives for a world at peace, the goal envisioned at its creation 58 years ago.</source>

Mandates are often the result of long and complex negotiations between Council members, however, and reflect those compromises. Moreover, the resolution of the conflict itself may remain uncertain. Compromises resulting in certain ambiguities at the time of the establishment of the mission's mandate can be viewed as necessary for building international consensus. Consequently, Security Council resolutions, while defining to the best extent possible the terms of a mandate, often do not provide detailed guidelines for implementation. Therefore, the mandate is usually further elaborated through documents and decisions of the Security Council and the Secretary-General.</source>

A small number of military officers can provide technical support to political mediators conducting negotiations. The advice could range from the practical arrangements for monitoring ceasefire agreements to establishing the feasibility of proposals for the use of military capability and the suitability of military arrangements such as weapons-free and demilitarized zones, zones of separation and requirements for effective disarmament and demobilization.</source>

This is done through both static (observation posts) and mobile (regular patrols, inspections and investigations of suspected violations) means. There have been several UN peacekeeping operations in which observation and monitoring are the only tasks of the military component. In more complex operations, however, observation and monitoring may be just one element of the military component’s activities.</source>

Following the outbreak of hostilities in April 1948, the Security Council called for a ceasefire and established a Truce Commission for Palestine to supervise it. As the situation worsened, the Truce Commission, which consisted of consular representatives of Belgium, France and the U.S., asked the Council to send military observers to assist it in supervising the ceasefire.</source>

They were to operate with the consent of the parties and were dependent on the cooperation of the parties for their effectiveness. Although there was no element of coercion in their functioning, their very presence was a deterrent to violations of the truce. Because they represented the will of the international community, they exercised a degree of moral suasion.

Following the wars of 1956, 1967 and 1973, the functions of the observers changed along with the circumstances, but they remained in the area, acting as go-betweens for the hostile parties and as the means by which isolated incidents could be contained and prevented from escalating into major conflicts.</source>

More recently, activities in support of the criminal justice system, namely the judiciary and corrections systems, have complemented the law enforcement and police reform efforts in providing greater security and justice to people in conflict-torn societies.</source>

Addressing common community and policing concerns through, and with, the community can help to ensure that improvements in law and order are better understood and accepted by the population. As such, community policing is a key approach for civilian police in peacekeeping missions. Many host countries of peacekeeping operations have certain entrenched local policing practices. These can be adapted to include modern community policing practices. The local communities must be encouraged to address their own social problems.

In conjunction with these entities, donors and the World Bank, which is a key funder of post-conflict reconstruction and rehabilitation, the gender unit or office can set up a consultative or advisory mechanism to mainstream gender in joint reconstruction efforts. All of these agencies have developed policies, tools and resources for gender mainstreaming in their specific areas of intervention. Such collaborative efforts could facilitate a better use of resources and reduce duplication, which can be critical if the gender unit or office is under-resourced.</source>

All components are heavily dependent on the support structure to be able to perform and meet mission objectives. The relationship between the substantive components and the mission support elements is, therefore, of critical importance. Innovative approaches, such as the concept of integrated support services, have been adopted to improve cooperation among all components and integrated planning for a more rational use of mission assets and resources. Mission support elements, which must comply with strict rules and regulations of the Organization, sometimes face criticism for not being responsive enough to mission operational requirements, especially during crises. Knowing the roles and responsibilities of all components and elements can contribute to a common understanding of priorities and the provision of optimum support with necessary controls.</source>

More recently, it has entailed establishing and advancing democratic principles and political rights. Today the UN system is engaged in a wide range of development assistance activities that support the efforts of governments around the world to promote democratic election processes. As one of the most credible and experienced global organizations in the implementation of electoral projects and operations, the UN receives more requests for electoral assistance than it can address. Since 1989, the UN has received over 290 requests for electoral assistance from Member States and has responded to more than 200.</source>

Generally, the Bank’s IDA resources are dispersed based on policy performance evaluated by the country policy and institutional assessment (CPIA) indicators. A country gets more resources the better its implementation of economic and social policies that promote growth and poverty reduction. This often works against post- conflict countries, however, since they typically have performed poorly on this front at the very time they most need financial resources. The Bank, therefore, devised a new set of indicators better tailored for post-conflict countries, such as human security and progress towards peace and governance. A country is typically expected to return to IDA’s regular (CPIA-based) allocation process within three years.</source>

Located in the Social Development Department in World Bank Headquarters in Washington, D.C., the unit supports the Bank in conflict analysis and project design in conflict-affected countries and develops tools and strategies to deal with development in conflict areas. The CPR unit is also responsible for the PCF, which supports the planning, piloting and analysis of ground-breaking activities by funding governments and partner organizations in early stages of transition from conflict to peace.</source>

Entities seeking grants develop their projects in close collaboration with the relevant country operations offices of the Bank and must have the approval of the country director.

Peacekeeping operations that have a mandate to act as a UN transitional administration, such as the United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo (UNMIK) and the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor (UNTAET), have broad responsibilities for governance and administration but are only able to support the building of national institutions and capacity for the duration of their mandate. These types of peacekeeping missions may enable significant short-term progress in a host country but may not always be conducive to longer term national capacity-building, and the flow of international personnel and resources may diminish considerably once the operation ends.</source>
